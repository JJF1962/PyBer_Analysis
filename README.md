# PyBer_Analysis
##  Overview
The objective of this analysis was to review the data, sort, visulize  and evaluate the performace of PyBer. ride sharing app company, doing an analysisi of the city_ data and ride_data csv files, providing affordability to PyBer to have better understanding and access to the market. However the class objective was to learn and apply our Knowledge of 
Python, Jupyter Notebook, handle csv files determine, mean, median and mode usingg Pandas, NumPy and SciPy statistics.

##  Results
It was a very challenging, in my case from the beginning to the end, It was necessary to use differnt  codes to generate charts, dataframe and one graph that allowed to present a better visualization of the data, it was clearly identified that the urban sector (cities), contribute with the biggest Total fares and the largest quantities of rides, followed by the suburban and lastly by the rural areas as shown in the figure below.

It is important to mention, that the Urban areas have the majority of the drivers, consequentially the average fare per ride is the lowest US$ 24.53, if we compare with the other two categories.

As you can see in the plot below, the fare lines run and and never cross one with eah other, also shows that the fares are higher in some periods more than other, with tendency to continue growing.

My class biggest challenge was to create a special code with support of learning assistance, in order to run the seconds in the Jupyter Notybook, to properly run the data and produce the required deliveries such as the graph show in the last image presented in this document, we add the following code, to properly run all  in my computer: seride_data_df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(ride_data_df['date'])

##  Summary
  * Investigate the volume spikes in the line plot, causes and how to perform and increase profitability
  * Evaluate posibilities to increase airfare in the urban areas, depending of competition, to increase the avergae fare per ride.
  * Consider this repott as preliminary information and and generate an action plan to identify the specific heat areas in each city to increase business
